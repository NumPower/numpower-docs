# NDArray::slice

```php
public function slice(...$indices): NDArray|float;
```
Array slicing, each argument represents a slice of a dimension.

Empty arrays represent all values of a dimension, arrays with values are treated in
the format `[start, stop, step]`, when only one value exists, it is automatically
assigned to stop `[0, stop, 1]`, the default value of start is 0 and step is 1.

When instead of an array, a number is passed, it is also assigned to the
stop of that dimension `[0, stop, 1]`.
