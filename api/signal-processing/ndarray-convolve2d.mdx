# NDArray::convolve2d

```php
public static function convolve2d(NDArray|array|GdImage $a, NDArray|array|GdImage $b, string $mode, string $boundary, scalar $fill_value = 0.0f): NDArray;
```
Convolve two 2-dimensional arrays.

Convolve `$a` and `$b` with output size determined by `$mode`, and boundary conditions determined by `$boundary` and `$fill_value`.

#### $mode options

- **full** - Full discrete linear convolution of the inputs
- **valid** - The output consists only of those elements that do not rely on the zero-padding. In ‘valid’ mode, either `$a` or `$b` must be at least as large as the other in every dimension.
- **same** - The output is the same size as `$a`, centered with respect to the ‘full’ output.

#### $boundary options

- **fill** - Pad input arrays with `$fill_value`
- **wrap** - Circular boundary
- **symm** - Symmetrical boundary

## Parameters

### `$a` `$b`
  - **Type** - NDArray | array | GdImage
  - The arrays to perform the convolution.

### `$mode`
  - **Type** - string
  - The size of the output. Can be: `full`, `valid` and `same`

### `$boundary`
  - **Type** - string
  - A flag indicating how to handle boundaries. Can be: `fill`, `wrap` and `symm`
