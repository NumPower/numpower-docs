# NDArray::dot

```php
public static function dot(NDArray|array|scalar $a, NDArray|array|scalar $b): NDArray;
```
The `dot` function performs the dot product of two arrays. The behaviour of the function
varies depending on the dimensions and shapes of the input arrays:

- If both `$a` and `$b` are 1-D arrays, the dot product is computed as the inner product of the vectors.
- If both `$a` and `$b` are 2-D arrays, the dot product is computed as the matrix multiplication
(See <a href="/api/linear-algebra/ndarray-matmul">NDArray::matmul</a>).
- If either `$a` or `$b` is a 0-D (scalar) array, the dot product is equivalent to element-wise multiplication.
(See <a href="/api/mathematical-functions/ndarray-multiply">NDArray::multiply</a>).
- If `$a` is an N-D array and `$b` is a 1-D array, the dot product is computed as the
sum product over the last axis of `$a` and `$b`.

## Parameters

### `$a` `$b`
> **Type** `NDArray`|`array`|`long`|`double`
>- The arrays to perfom the dot product.


---

## Return

> **Type** - NDArray
>- If both `$a` and `$b` are scalars or 1-D arrays, the dot product operation yields a scalar value.
In this case, a single scalar is returned as the result.
>- If either `$a` or `$b` is a scalar and the other is an array, or if both `$a` and `$b` are arrays
with any dimensionality greater than 1, the dot product operation results in an array.
The returned array will have a shape determined by the dimensions of `$a` and `$b` according
to the dot product rules.
