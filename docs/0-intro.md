# About NumPower

Inspired by NumPy, the NumPower library was created to provide the foundation for efficient scientific computing 
in PHP, as well as leverage the machine learning tools and libraries that already exist and can benefit from it.

This C extension developed for PHP can be used to considerably speed up mathematical operations on large datasets 
and facilitate the manipulation, creation and operation of N-dimensional tensors.
