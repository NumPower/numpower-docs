# Image Processing

When NumPower is compiled in an environment with PHP-GD available, functions to facilitate
image manipulation will be available for use.

You can use a `GdImage` image to build an NDArray or as an argument for the different types of operations
available, making image processing fast and with the possibility of performing image processing using a GPU.

```php
use \NDArray as nd;

$gd_image = imagecreatefromjpeg("test_img.jpg");

$gd_image_array = nd:array($gd_image);
```

## NumPower Image Tools

We are creating a library for processing images with CPU and GPU using the NumPower extension and PHP-GD.
To install the library just use the command below in an environment with composer installed.
```
composer require numpower/image
```


For now you can create RGB Images and perform some filters, we will work to create more methods and features for image manipulation.

```php
use NumPower\Image\ImageRGB;

$img = new ImageRGB("test_img.jpg", use_gpu: True); // Set $use_gpu to False for CPU computation

$img->emboss(intensity: 2);
$img->sobelHorizontal();

$img->save("out.jpg");
```
