# Image Processing

When NumPower is compiled in an environment with PHP-GD available, functions to facilitate
image manipulation will be available for use.

You can use a `GdImage` image to build an NDArray or as an argument for the different types of operations
available, making image processing fast and with the possibility of performing image processing using a GPU.

```php
use \NDArray as nd;

$gd_image = imagecreatefromjpeg("test_img.jpg");

$gd_image_array = nd:array($gd_image);
```
