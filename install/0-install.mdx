# Installing NumPower

This page provides instructions for installing NumPower, a powerful numerical computing library for PHP inspired
by the functionality of NumPy in Python. NumPower enables efficient array operations, mathematical functions, and
tools for manipulating and analyzing numerical data in PHP.

NumPower is implemented as a PHP extension, which requires a compilation process to install it in your PHP environment.
There are two methods for installing NumPower: using a Docker image or compiling the extension
from the source.
