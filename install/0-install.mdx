The NumPower library does not have a release and is in preview. This was done so that more people can test and report problems.

We do not recommend using this library in production environments in its current state. Memory errors like overflow, leaks and unpredictable values ​​can happen.

This page provides instructions for installing NumPower, a powerful numerical computing library for PHP inspired
by the functionality of NumPy in Python. NumPower enables efficient array operations, mathematical functions, and
tools for manipulating and analyzing numerical data in PHP.

NumPower is implemented as a PHP extension, which requires a compilation process to install it in your PHP environment.
There are two methods for installing NumPower: using a Docker image or compiling the extension
from the source.
