# Docker Image

If you prefer a hassle-free installation process, you can use a pre-built Docker image that includes NumPower
and its dependencies. The Docker image provides a convenient and isolated environment to run your
PHP code with NumPower already installed.

To install NumPower using the Docker image, follow these steps:

- Install Docker on your system by following the instructions provided by Docker for your operating system.

- Pull the NumPower Docker image from the Docker Hub by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
docker pull numpower/numpower:ubuntu-php82
```

- For GPU support with CUDA, use the one of the following images:

```bash
docker pull numpower/numpower:ubuntu-php82-cuda-11
docker pull numpower/numpower:ubuntu-php82-cuda-12
```

- Once the image is downloaded, you can run your PHP code with NumPower
by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

#### CPU Run

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/code:/app numpower/numpower:ubuntu-php82 php /app/your-script.php
```

#### GPU Run
Make sure you have nvidia-container-toolkit installed and that your docker is configured and ready to use the GPU

```

> Replace /path/to/your/code with the path to your PHP code on the host machine. Also, replace your-script.php with the name of your PHP script that uses NumPower.

This command mounts your local code directory into the Docker container and runs the PHP script with NumPower.

Using the Docker image provides a convenient way to start using NumPower without worrying about the compilation
process. However, if you prefer to compile NumPower from the source, continue reading for the alternative method.
